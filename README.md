# Demon
Cell Automata Variation

Implementation of a Cell Automata variation named "Demon"

Cell Automata is the manipulation of cell states bassed on its neighbouring cell's state.
Cell states range from 0-7 with each state being represented by a differnt colour (some with states being the same colour).

The cells used to determin change can either be Orthagonal or Diagonal from the origin cell.
